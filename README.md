# Information-Retrieval-Engine
A program that scrapes the web from a given starting point and can then be used to search for pages related to key words input by the user. 

The user can choose to use more open ended "or" boolean searches or stricter "and" searches, as well as choosing between two different ranking systems that score documents differently with an emphasis on the more uncommon terms that appear.

Document indexing is based on SPIMI inversion techniques.
